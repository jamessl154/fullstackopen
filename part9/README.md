[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) is a typed superset of JavaScript. Its main advantages are static type checking to reduce runtime errors, code-level documentation and a better development experience in an IDE i.e. more relevant suggestions using VSCode with IntelliSense. Used [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) that allows execution of TS files in Node.js without compiling. Imported types from the community project [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

- bmi
  - Developed ```bmi/bmiCalculator.ts``` that calculates BMI using height and weight inputs. The program exposes an interface containing the functions apiBmi and cliBmi that both validate their input types and rely on the function calculateBmi. cliBmi can be used by running ```npm run cliBmi <height> <weight>```. apiBmi is used in the GET /bmi route of the Express server in ```bmi/index.ts``` with height and weight as [query string parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query). ```bmi/exerciseCalculator.ts``` is created similarly to the bmiCalculator but it generates an exercise report object after receiving input of target hours of exercise and an array of hours of exercise completed over an arbitrary number of days. To run cliExercises: ```npm run cliExercises <targetHours> <day1hours> <day2hours> e.t.c.```. Similarly the exerciseCalculator is integrated into the POST /exercises route of the Express server.
- half-stack
  - Basic React app that displays data initialized with TypeScript using ```npx create-react-app half-stack --template typescript```. Learned typing of props, how to implement exhaustive type checking, extending interfaces and creating/importing types.
- patientor-backend
  -  The patientor app is meant to be used by doctors to store records of patient health, visits and diagnoses. Developed the backend from scratch to serve [this](https://github.com/fullstack-hy/patientor) existing frontend. The data for the app is only stored in memory but we seed some initial data from the ```patientor-backend/data``` directory. Learned how to use [utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) and applied them. For example, [Omit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys) to exclude sensitive information from the Patient interface when responding with patient information. Implemented type [narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) in ```utils/toNewEntry.ts``` and ```utils/toNewPatient.ts``` to parse the request object, verify that the properties exist and have the expected types, for us to use more safely in the rest of our code.
- patientor
  - Worked on expanding the patientor app simultaneously adding features for the backend and the frontend that worked when used together, were styled appropriately (frontend features with [SemanticUI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)) and typed correctly. We first cloned the [frontend repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy/patientor) which was an existing codebase. Learned about how to use [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) as an alternate state management tool, using it in combination with the [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) hook and retrieving the current context in components with the [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) hook from the nearest [Context.Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider). Learned how to use and applied [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) for simplified form management with respect to form state, validation, error handling and form submission.
